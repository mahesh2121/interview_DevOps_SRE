# New Relic Implementation with Example Application

## 1. **What is the first step in implementing New Relic with an example application?**

**Answer**:  
The first step in implementing New Relic is to create a New Relic account and get your **license key**. After obtaining the license key, you need to install the **New Relic agent** appropriate for your applicationâ€™s programming language (e.g., Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby).

For example, if you are using a **Node.js** application:
1. Install the New Relic Node.js agent:
   ```bash
   npm install newrelic --save

You will need to configure the agent by editing the newrelic.js file.

2. Which file needs to be configured to integrate New Relic with a Node.js application?

Answer:
In a Node.js application, the file that needs to be configured is newrelic.js, which is created automatically when you install the New Relic agent. This file contains various configuration options, including the New Relic license key and the application name.

Example of a newrelic.js configuration file:

exports.config = {
  app_name: ['My Application Name'],  // Name of your app
  license_key: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY',  // Your New Relic license key
  logging: {
    level: 'info'  // Logging level for New Relic agent
  }
};

3. How do you configure the license key in the New Relic agent?

Answer:
The license key for New Relic is configured in the newrelic.js configuration file, which is located in the root directory of your application.

Example:

exports.config = {
  license_key: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY',  // Replace with your New Relic license key
};

Alternatively, you can also configure the license key as an environment variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY for a more secure setup.
4. What changes need to be made to the main application file (e.g., app.js in Node.js) to initialize New Relic?

Answer:
In Node.js, the New Relic agent needs to be required at the very top of your main application file (e.g., app.js or server.js). This is to ensure that New Relic starts monitoring your application as soon as the application begins running.

Example for Node.js:

require('newrelic');  // This should be the first line of your application

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

By adding require('newrelic'); at the top, New Relic starts monitoring your application from the beginning.
5. What is the app_name configuration in the newrelic.js file used for?

Answer:
The app_name configuration in the newrelic.js file is used to define the name of the application that will appear in the New Relic dashboard. This name helps to identify your application in New Relic when you have multiple applications being monitored.

Example:

exports.config = {
  app_name: ['My Example Application'],  // This name will appear in the New Relic dashboard
  license_key: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY',
};

6. How can you enable custom logging in New Relic?

Answer:
To enable custom logging, you can modify the logging configuration in the newrelic.js file. You can set the logging level (e.g., trace, debug, info, warn, error) and specify where the logs should be sent (e.g., console or file).

Example:

exports.config = {
  logging: {
    level: 'debug',  // Available levels: trace, debug, info, warn, error
    enabled: true,  // Enable logging
  }
};

7. How do you monitor specific transactions with New Relic in a Node.js app?

Answer:
To monitor specific transactions, you can use the New Relic API to create custom transaction naming and monitor specific routes or functions. You can use newrelic.setTransactionName() to name a transaction manually.

Example in an Express app:

const newrelic = require('newrelic');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/custom-route', (req, res) => {
  newrelic.setTransactionName('CustomRoute/Transaction');  // Custom transaction name
  res.send('This is a custom route');
});

This will help you to track specific routes or endpoints in your application.
8. How do you configure New Relic to monitor a production environment differently from a development environment?

Answer:
You can configure New Relic to monitor production and development environments differently by setting the application name and logging level based on the environment. This can be done by checking the NODE_ENV variable and changing settings accordingly.

Example:

exports.config = {
  app_name: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? ['Production Application'] : ['Development Application'],
  license_key: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY',
  logging: {
    level: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'info' : 'debug',
  }
};

This approach allows you to have different settings based on the environment.
9. What file is typically used to configure a custom New Relic agent in a production Kubernetes environment?

Answer:
In a Kubernetes environment, custom configurations for New Relic can be injected into the application via environment variables or ConfigMaps. The New Relic agent is usually configured using the newrelic.js file or environment variables like NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY and NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.

For example, you can create a ConfigMap in Kubernetes to provide the configuration:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: newrelic-config
data:
  NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY: "your_license_key"
  NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: "Kubernetes Application"

Then, mount this ConfigMap as environment variables in your pod definition.
10. How do you use custom instrumentation to track specific business metrics with New Relic?

Answer:
To track custom business metrics in New Relic, you can use the New Relic API to send custom events and metrics. The newrelic.recordMetric() method allows you to record custom metrics that are specific to your business logic.

Example:

const newrelic = require('newrelic');

// Record a custom metric for user signups
newrelic.recordMetric('Custom/SignUp', 1);

// You can also track more specific business metrics:
newrelic.recordMetric('Custom/OrderValue', 50);

These custom metrics can then be visualized in the New Relic dashboard and used to create custom alerts and reports.

ChatGPT

In the context of New Relic, newrelic.ini and newrelic.config are configuration files used to set up and configure the New Relic agent for various programming environments, primarily for PHP and .NET applications. Let's take a closer look at each of these files and how they are used:
1. newrelic.ini (PHP)

The newrelic.ini file is used to configure the New Relic agent for PHP applications. This configuration file is typically placed in the /etc/php.d/ or /etc/php/7.x/mods-available/ directory, depending on your PHP setup.
Key Settings in newrelic.ini:

    newrelic.license: This setting defines the New Relic license key that is required to authenticate the agent with your New Relic account.
    newrelic.appname: This setting specifies the name of your application that will appear in the New Relic dashboard.
    newrelic.loglevel: Defines the level of logging to use for the New Relic agent (e.g., info, debug, error).
    newrelic.enabled: A setting that enables or disables the New Relic agent. This can be useful if you want to turn off the agent temporarily.

Example of newrelic.ini:

; Set your New Relic license key
newrelic.license = "YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY"

; Set your application name
newrelic.appname = "My PHP Application"

; Set the log level for New Relic (optional)
newrelic.loglevel = "info"

; Enable or disable New Relic agent (optional)
newrelic.enabled = true

How to Use newrelic.ini:

    After editing the newrelic.ini file with your configuration, restart your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, etc.) for the changes to take effect.

2. newrelic.config (.NET)

The newrelic.config file is used for .NET applications to configure the New Relic agent. This file is typically located in the C:\Program Files\New Relic\New Relic .NET Agent\ directory.
Key Settings in newrelic.config:

    licenseKey: The New Relic license key used to authenticate the agent with your New Relic account.
    appName: The name of your .NET application that will appear in the New Relic dashboard.
    logLevel: The log level for New Relic logs (e.g., info, debug, error).
    highSecurity: This setting controls whether the agent operates in high security mode, limiting the types of data that the agent collects.

Example of newrelic.config:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <config>
    <!-- New Relic License Key -->
    <licenseKey>YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY</licenseKey>

    <!-- New Relic Application Name -->
    <appName>My .NET Application</appName>

    <!-- New Relic Log Level -->
    <logLevel>info</logLevel>

    <!-- Enable or disable high security mode -->
    <highSecurity>false</highSecurity>

    <!-- Other configuration options -->
  </config>
</configuration>

How to Use newrelic.config:

    Edit the newrelic.config file with the appropriate settings.
    After making changes, you will need to restart your .NET application for the changes to take effect.
    Make sure the New Relic .NET agent is installed on the server hosting the application.

Differences Between newrelic.ini and newrelic.config
Aspect	newrelic.ini	newrelic.config
Platform	Used in PHP applications	Used in .NET applications
Format	INI (plain text)	XML (markup format)
Location	Typically found in /etc/php.d/ or /etc/php/ (depending on OS)	Located in C:\Program Files\New Relic\ (Windows)
Primary Settings	License Key, App Name, Log Level	License Key, App Name, Log Level, High Security
Additional Notes:

    PHP (newrelic.ini): If you're using PHP, the newrelic.ini file must be loaded into the PHP configuration. You can verify this by running php -i | grep newrelic to check if the New Relic extension is enabled.
    .NET (newrelic.config): The .NET configuration file is part of the New Relic .NET Agent installation and is typically used to fine-tune how New Relic integrates with your .NET application. Ensure the New Relic agent is installed correctly on your applicationâ€™s host machine.

Conclusion:

Both newrelic.ini and newrelic.config are configuration files used for specific platforms (PHP and .NET). They are essential for configuring the New Relic agent and customizing how it collects and reports performance data for your applications.f
