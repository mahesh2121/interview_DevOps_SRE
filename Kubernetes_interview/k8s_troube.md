Troubleshooting list

    Chart Compatibility and Dependencies

    Problem: Helm charts may have dependencies on specific versions of Kubernetes or other charts, leading to deployment failures.

    Solution: Ensure Helm charts and dependencies are compatible with the target Kubernetes environment and conduct thorough testing.

    Configuration Management

    Problem: Misconfigurations within Helm values or template files can cause deployment errors.

    Solution: Validate Helm value files for accuracy and use Helm’s templating capabilities to generate proper Kubernetes configuration files.

    Rollbacks and Upgrades

    Problem: Failed upgrades or rollbacks can leave the application in an unstable state.

    Solution: Take backups of previous releases and use Helm’s rollback and history commands to track and revert changes when necessary.

    Version Control

    Problem: Lack of version control for Helm charts can lead to ambiguity in deployments.

    Solution: Use version control systems like Git to manage Helm charts and create versioned releases for each chart.

    RBAC and Permissions

    Problem: Inadequate permissions or RBAC settings can result in deployment errors.

    Solution: Configure proper RBAC rules and permissions for Helm deployments.

    Security Concerns

    Problem: Kubernetes clusters can be complex and vulnerable to security breaches.

    Solution: Improve security with modules like AppArmor and SELinux, enable RBAC, and use separate containers for front-end and back-end.

    Networking Issues

    Problem: Networking misconfigurations can lead to inaccessible services.

    Solution: Verify network policies and service configurations to ensure proper communication between pods and services.

    Persistent Storage Problems

    Problem: Incorrectly configured persistent volumes can cause data loss.

    Solution: Double-check persistent volume claims and storage class definitions for accuracy.

    Resource Limitations

    Problem: Pods may fail to start if they hit resource limits.

    Solution: Adjust resource requests and limits in pod specifications to match the workload requirements.

    Image Pull Issues

    Problem: 'ImagePullBackOff' errors occur when Kubernetes cannot pull a container image.

    Solution: Ensure the image name and tag are correct and the registry is accessible.

    CrashLoopBackOff Errors

    Problem: A pod is repeatedly crashing and restarting.

    Solution: Check logs for the crashing container and address the underlying issue causing the crash.

    Service Discovery Failures

    Problem: Pods cannot discover services due to DNS issues.

    Solution: Verify the DNS configuration and ensure the service names are correctly defined.

    Orphaned Resources

    Problem: Resources not cleaned up after deleting a release.

    Solution: Use 'helm delete --purge' to remove all resources associated with a release.

    Helm Release Stuck in Pending State

    Problem: A Helm release is stuck and not progressing.

    Solution: Investigate the pending operations and consider force-deleting the release if necessary.

    Ingress Configuration Errors

    Problem: Ingress resources are not routing traffic correctly.

    Solution: Review and correct the ingress resource definitions and annotations.
