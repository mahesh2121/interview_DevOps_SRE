How is OIDC integrated with kubernetes?

kubernetes application and kubernetes cluster

Benfits:

    centrailzed identity managment
    simplied integration with exiting identity provider
    enhanced security with jwt-based authentication


Oidc provider setup:

      choose an oidc provider 
      configurae the provider with a client id,client secret,and redirect urls

kubenetes API configuration:

  add the following flags to kube-apiserver to enable oidc

    --oidc-issuer-url=<oidc-issue-url>
    --oidc-client-id=<client-id>
    --oidc-username-claim=<uername-claim>
    --oidc-groups-claim=<groups-claims>

Authenticalion flow

User authenticate via the oidc provider

    the provider issue the an ID token to the user.
    Users include the token in the authentication header
    accessing the kubernetes API

RBAC integration

    define cluster role and cluster rolebinding or role and rolebinding to map oidc-authenticated users and groups to specific permission in k8s

exmaple code

    apiversion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind:ClusterRolebinding
    metadata:
        name:oidc-admini-binding
    subjects:
       -kind: User
        name: "user@exmaple.com
        apigroup:rbac.authentication.k8s.io
    roleref:
        kind: Clusterole
        name: Cluster-admin
        apiGroup: rbac.authentication.k8s.io

verify token
    kubernetse vertifies the id token's singnature and claims against the oidc providers public keys and configuration this ensure tokens are valid and unaltered.
