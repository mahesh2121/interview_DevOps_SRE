🛠 Basic Git & DVCS Questions
1. What is a distributed version control system? How does it differ from a centralized version control system?

✅ Distributed Version Control System (DVCS):

    In a DVCS (e.g., Git, AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, GitLab), every developer has a full copy of the repository on their local machine.
    This allows them to work offline and commit changes locally before pushing to a remote repository.

✅ Centralized Version Control System (CVCS):

    In a CVCS (e.g., SVN, Perforce), there is a single central repository, and developers pull/push changes directly to it.
    If the central server goes down, developers lose access to the version history.

Feature	DVCS (Git, CodeCommit)	CVCS (SVN, Perforce)
Offline Work	✅ Yes	❌ No
Central Server Dependency	❌ No	✅ Yes
Performance	✅ Faster	❌ Slower
2. What are the key advantages of Git over other version control systems?

✅ Advantages of Git:

    Distributed → Developers have a full copy of the repo and can work offline.
    Fast Performance → Most operations are local, making Git faster.
    Branching & Merging → Cheap and efficient branches enable flexible workflows.
    Security → Uses SHA-1 to ensure data integrity.
    Large Community → Widely used and supported.

3. Explain the difference between git clone and git init.

✅ git clone <repo_url> → Creates a copy of an existing remote repository.
✅ git init → Initializes an empty repository in the current directory.

# Clone an existing repo
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Initialize a new repo locally
git init

4. What is the purpose of git pull and git fetch? How are they different?

✅ git fetch: Downloads changes from the remote but does not merge them.
✅ git pull: Fetches changes and merges them into the current branch.

git fetch origin   # Downloads remote changes
git pull origin main  # Downloads and merges changes into 'main'

5. How does Git handle merging conflicts? How do you resolve them?

    When two developers change the same part of a file, Git cannot merge automatically.
    Git marks the conflict in the file:

git merge feature-branch
# Conflict detected!

🛠 Steps to resolve conflicts:

    Open the conflicted file.
    Look for conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
    Choose the correct changes and edit the file.
    Stage the resolved file:

    git add conflicted_file.txt
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"

6. What is the difference between git merge and git rebase? When would you use each?

✅ git merge → Combines changes while keeping history. Creates a merge commit.
✅ git rebase → Moves (rebases) commits on top of another branch without merge commits.

# Merge: Keeps history (preferred for team workflows)
git merge feature-branch

# Rebase: Cleaner history (preferred for individual work)
git rebase main

📌 Use merge for feature integration, rebase for linear history.
🔍 Branching & Workflow Questions
7. What is Git branching? How does it help in software development?

    Git branches allow developers to work on features in isolation.
    Main types:
        main → Production branch.
        develop → Integration branch.
        feature/* → Feature branches.
        hotfix/* → Emergency fixes.

git branch feature-login  # Create a branch
git checkout feature-login  # Switch to it

8. Explain the difference between a local branch and a remote branch.

✅ Local branch → Exists only on your machine.
✅ Remote branch → Exists on GitHub/CodeCommit and is shared with the team.

git branch -a  # List local & remote branches

9. What is GitFlow? How is it different from GitHub Flow?

✅ GitFlow:

    Uses main, develop, feature, hotfix, and release branches.
    Best for enterprise projects with staged releases.

✅ GitHub Flow:

    Only main and feature branches.
    Best for continuous deployment.

10. How do you delete a local and remote branch in Git?

git branch -d feature-branch   # Delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature-branch  # Delete remote branch

📦 Commit & History Management Questions
11. How do you revert a commit that has already been pushed?

git revert <commit_id>  # Creates a new commit to undo changes
git push origin main

🚨 Avoid git reset --hard on shared branches!
12. What is git cherry-pick and when would you use it?

✅ git cherry-pick <commit_id> applies a specific commit from another branch without merging the entire branch.

git cherry-pick abc1234  # Apply commit abc1234 to current branch

🌐 Remote Repositories & Collaboration
13. What is AWS CodeCommit? How does it compare to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket?

✅ AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed Git repository service by AWS.

    No size limits, integrates with IAM policies.
    Better for AWS workloads (EC2, Lambda, CodePipeline).
    Less community support than GitHub/GitLab.

14. How do you configure Git to work with AWS CodeCommit?

git config --global credential.helper '!aws codecommit credential-helper $@'
git config --global credential.UseHttpPath true

📌 This allows secure AWS authentication via IAM roles.
🚨 Advanced & Troubleshooting Questions
15. What happens if you accidentally delete a branch? How can you recover it?

git reflog  # Find the last commit of the deleted branch
git checkout -b branch-name <commit-id>  # Restore the branch

16. How would you handle a scenario where two developers push conflicting changes?

1️⃣ git pull --rebase origin main (Pull latest changes).
2️⃣ Resolve conflicts.
3️⃣ git push origin main.
17. How can you optimize a Git repository that has grown too large?

✅ Remove large files with:

git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch largefile.zip' HEAD
git push origin --force --all

✅ Use Git LFS for storing large files.

Here are the answers to the remaining questions on Git, AWS CodeCommit, and distributed version control systems:
📦 Commit & History Management (Continued)
13. Explain the difference between git commit --amend and git reset.

✅ git commit --amend → Modifies the most recent commit without changing history.

    Useful for correcting commit messages or adding missed changes.

git commit --amend -m "Updated commit message"

✅ git reset → Rewinds history to an earlier commit.

    Soft reset (--soft): Keeps changes staged.
    Mixed reset (--mixed): Unstages changes but keeps them in the working directory.
    Hard reset (--hard): Deletes changes permanently.

git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Delete last commit

14. How do you squash multiple commits into one?

✅ Use interactive rebase (git rebase -i):

git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Squash last 3 commits

    Mark all but the first commit as squash (s), then save.

✅ Alternative (merge commits into one new commit):

git reset --soft HEAD~3
git commit -m "Squashed commit"

15. How do you find a specific commit using Git commands?

✅ Find by commit message:

git log --grep="fix bug"

✅ Find by author:

git log --author="Mahesh"

✅ Find by content:

git log -S "function_name"

✅ Find in all branches:

git log --all --grep="fix bug"

16. What is git reflog and how can it help recover lost commits?

✅ git reflog tracks all recent changes, including deleted commits.

If you accidentally delete a branch:

git reflog  # Find the commit hash
git checkout -b my-branch <commit-hash>

📌 Useful when resetting to an earlier state.
🌐 Remote Repositories & Collaboration (Continued)
17. How do you set up a new AWS CodeCommit repository and clone it locally?

✅ Step 1: Create a repository in AWS CodeCommit.
✅ Step 2: Set up credentials:

git config --global credential.helper '!aws codecommit credential-helper $@'
git config --global credential.UseHttpPath true

✅ Step 3: Clone the repository:

git clone https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/my-repo

18. How do you force push (git push --force)? When is it safe to use?

✅ git push --force overwrites the remote branch with your local changes.
✅ Safe use cases:

    After rebasing a private branch.
    When working alone on a feature branch.
    ❌ Avoid on shared branches (main or develop), as it can erase others' commits.

19. How do you use Git hooks? Can you give an example of a pre-commit hook?

✅ Git hooks are scripts that run before or after certain Git actions (commit, push).

Example pre-commit hook (prevent commits with TODO comments):

#!/bin/sh
if grep -r "TODO" .; then
  echo "Commit rejected! Remove TODO comments."
  exit 1
fi

✅ Save this script in .git/hooks/pre-commit and make it executable:

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

20. What is a Git submodule? When would you use it?

✅ Git submodules allow including another Git repository inside a parent repository.

    Used when managing shared libraries or dependencies.

Example: Add a submodule:

git submodule add https://github.com/example/library.git libs/library

Update submodules:

git submodule update --init --recursive

🚨 Advanced & Troubleshooting Questions (Continued)
21. What happens if you accidentally delete a branch? How can you recover it?

✅ Recover a deleted branch using git reflog:

git reflog  # Find the last commit hash
git checkout -b my-branch <commit-hash>

22. How would you handle a scenario where two developers push conflicting changes?

✅ Scenario:

    Developer A and Developer B both make changes to feature-branch.
    Developer A pushes first, then Developer B’s push is rejected.

✅ Steps to resolve:

git pull --rebase origin feature-branch  # Rebase local changes on top of remote

    If conflicts appear, fix them, then:

git add .
git rebase --continue
git push origin feature-branch

23. How can you optimize a Git repository that has grown too large?

✅ 1. Remove large files from history:

git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch largefile.zip' HEAD

✅ 2. Use Git LFS (Large File Storage):

git lfs track "*.zip"

✅ 3. Clean up unnecessary history:

git gc --aggressive

💡 Scenario-Based Questions (Continued)
24. A teammate force-pushed to a shared branch and removed some of your commits. How do you recover them?

✅ Step 1: Check your local commit history:

git reflog

✅ Step 2: Find the last commit before the force push, then reset:

git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push origin feature-branch --force

🚨 Only use --force if necessary.
25. You need to migrate a repository from GitHub to AWS CodeCommit. How would you do it?

✅ Step 1: Clone the existing GitHub repository:

git clone --mirror https://github.com/user/repo.git
cd repo

✅ Step 2: Add CodeCommit as a remote:

git remote set-url origin https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/new-repo

✅ Step 3: Push to AWS CodeCommit:

git push --mirror origin

✅ Step 4: Clone the new repository:

git clone https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/new-repo

26. You are working in a team where multiple developers work on the same feature branch. How do you avoid conflicts?

✅ Best practices:

    Use feature branches per developer.
    Pull and rebase before pushing:

    git pull --rebase origin feature-branch

    Use pull requests with code reviews.

27. You need to automate code reviews before merging into the main branch. How would you implement this?

✅ Use GitHub Actions or AWS CodeBuild with CodeCommit:

    Set up a CI/CD pipeline to run tests and linting.
    Configure branch protection rules to enforce code reviews.

Example GitHub Actions CI workflow (.github/workflows/main.yml):

name: Code Review
on: pull_request
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
