Explain the difference between application load balancer and network loadbalancer in aws in which scerarios would you choose one over the other?



AWS provides two major types of load balancers: Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB). Each is suited for specific use cases, depending on the application requirements and traffic patterns.

1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
    Layer: Operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer) of the OSI model.
    Protocol Support: Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket.
Features:
    Intelligent routing based on content (e.g., path-based, host-based routing).
    Native support for AWS services like ECS, EKS, and Lambda.
    SSL/TLS termination.
    WebSocket support for real-time communication.
    Advanced features like WAF (Web Application Firewall) and Sticky Sessions.
    Can route to multiple target groups based on rules.
When to Use ALB:
    Web Applications: Ideal for routing HTTP/HTTPS traffic to multiple backend services.
    Microservices Architecture: Host-based and path-based routing make it suitable for service-specific requests (e.g., /api to one service, /auth to another).
    Content-Based Routing: For applications where requests need to be routed differently based on headers, query strings, or paths.
    Serverless Applications: ALB can directly invoke Lambda functions.

Example Scenario for ALB:
You’re hosting a web application with a frontend, backend API, and authentication service. Use ALB to route requests based on paths:

/api → API backend.
/login → Authentication service.
/ → Frontend application.

2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
    Layer: Operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) of the OSI model.
    Protocol Support: Supports TCP, UDP, and TLS.
Features:
    Extremely low latency.
    Scales to handle millions of requests per second.
    Can preserve the source IP of the client.
    Handles volatile traffic patterns efficiently.
    Supports TLS termination and pass-through.
    Suitable for static IP use cases (Elastic IP can be assigned to NLB).
When to Use NLB:
    High Performance: Applications that require ultra-low latency and high throughput, such as gaming or real-time applications.
    Non-HTTP Traffic: For workloads using non-HTTP protocols like SMTP, MQTT, or custom protocols.
    Preserving Source IP: Use cases where backend services need to see the client’s original IP address.
    Fixed IP Requirements: Applications needing a static IP address for whitelisting or compliance.

Example Scenario for NLB:
You’re running a gaming application that needs to handle real-time multiplayer interactions over TCP or UDP. Use NLB for low latency and high throughput.

Comparison Table
Feature	Application Load Balancer (ALB)	Network Load Balancer (NLB)
Layer	Layer 7 (Application Layer)	Layer 4 (Transport Layer)
Protocol Support	HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket	TCP, UDP, TLS
Latency	Higher latency than NLB	Ultra-low latency
Routing Features	Content-based routing (host/path/query)	Simple IP-based routing
Source IP Preservation	No (Uses private IPs in headers)	Yes
Elastic IP Support	No	Yes
Integration	Best for HTTP-based services (ECS, Lambda)	Best for raw protocols and static IP use
Cost	Higher cost (processing intensive)	Lower cost for raw data transfer
