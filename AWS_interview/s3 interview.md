Basic S3 Concepts
Q1: What is Amazon S3, and what are its main use cases?
A: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service for storing and retrieving any amount of data from anywhere.
Main use cases:

            Backups
            Disaster recovery
            Data archiving
            Content distribution
            Static website hosting

Q2: What types of data can be stored in S3?
A: S3 can store any type of object data, including text files, images, videos, logs, and large binary data like backups or machine learning models.

Q3: How does S3 ensure high durability?
A: S3 provides 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability by automatically replicating data across multiple Availability Zones.

Q4: What are the different storage classes in S3?
A: Storage classes include:

S3 Standard
S3 Intelligent-Tiering
S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
S3 One Zone-IA
S3 Glacier
S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Q5: What is an S3 bucket, and how is it different from an object?
A: A bucket is a container for storing objects, while an object is the data file along with its metadata stored in the bucket.

S3 Security
Q6: How can you secure an S3 bucket?
A: Use the following:

Bucket policies
IAM roles
Access control lists (ACLs)
Enable encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or client-side encryption)

Q7: What is S3 Bucket Policy, and how does it work?
A: A bucket policy is a JSON document defining permissions for the bucket, allowing or denying access based on conditions like IP range, request type, or principal.

Q8: How do you ensure data in an S3 bucket is encrypted?
A: Enable Server-Side Encryption (SSE) using:

SSE-S3 (managed by S3)
SSE-KMS (AWS Key Management Service)
SSE-C (customer-provided keys)
Command Example:

bash
Copy code
aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://mybucket/ --sse AES256

Q9: What is S3 Access Logging, and why is it important?
A: S3 Access Logging records detailed access information for a bucket, useful for auditing and security monitoring.

Q10: How can you prevent public access to an S3 bucket?
A: Use the "Block Public Access" setting and configure bucket policies and ACLs to deny public access.

Command Example:

bash
Copy code
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket mybucket --acl private

Lifecycle and Cost Optimization

Q11: What is an S3 Lifecycle Policy?
A: A Lifecycle Policy automates the transition of objects to different storage classes or deletion after a specified period.

Q12: How can you reduce S3 storage costs?
A: Use S3 Lifecycle Policies to transition data to lower-cost storage classes like Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive.

Q13: How do you delete objects in S3 older than 90 days?
A: Configure a Lifecycle Policy with an expiration rule to delete objects after 90 days.

Command Example:

bash
Copy code
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket mybucket --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle.json
lifecycle.json:

json
Copy code
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "DeleteOldObjects",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Filter": {},
      "Expiration": {
        "Days": 90
      }
    }
  ]
}

Performance and Availability

Q16: How does S3 provide high availability?
A: S3 replicates data across multiple Availability Zones, ensuring data is available even if one AZ fails.

Q17: How can you optimize S3 performance for large-scale data uploads?
A: Use Multipart Upload for files larger than 100MB, and leverage Transfer Acceleration for faster uploads across long distances.

Command Example:

bash
Copy code
aws s3 cp largefile.zip s3://mybucket/ --storage-class INTELLIGENT_TIERING
Q18: What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?
A: A feature that speeds up data transfers by routing traffic through Amazon CloudFront edge locations.

Q19: What are pre-signed URLs in S3, and when would you use them?
A: Pre-signed URLs grant temporary access to objects, useful for sharing private data without making the bucket public.

Command Example:

bash
Copy code
aws s3 presign s3://mybucket/myfile.txt --expires-in 3600
Monitoring and Alerts

Q26: How can you monitor S3 bucket access?
A: Use CloudTrail and S3 Access Logs to track API requests and access patterns.

Q27: How do you set up alerts for S3 bucket size exceeding a threshold?
A: Use Amazon CloudWatch with S3 metrics to trigger alerts when bucket size exceeds a defined threshold.

Command Example:

bash
Copy code
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name S3BucketSizeAlert \
--metric-name BucketSizeBytes --namespace AWS/S3 --statistic Average \
--period 86400 --threshold 5000000000 --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
--dimensions Name=BucketName,Value=mybucket --evaluation-periods 1 \
--alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:my-sns-topic
Advanced S3 Use Cases
Q31: How do you configure a static website using S3?
A: Enable Static Website Hosting on the bucket and upload HTML, CSS, and other assets.

Command Example:

bash
Copy code
aws s3 website s3://mybucket/ --index-document index.html --error-document error.html
Q32: What is S3 Event Notification, and how does it work?
A: S3 Event Notification triggers actions (e.g., Lambda functions) when specific events like object uploads or deletions occur.

Command Example:

bash
Copy code
aws s3api put-bucket-notification-configuration --bucket mybucket \
--notification-configuration file://notification.json
notification.json:

json
Copy code
{
  "LambdaFunctionConfigurations": [
    {
      "LambdaFunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:my-function",
      "Events": ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"]
    }
  ]
}
