AWS provides multiple services to detect, prevent, and respond to data leaks. Below are the key services categorized based on detection, prevention, and response.
üîç 1. Detection: Identifying Data Leaks
Service	Purpose	Key Features
Amazon Macie	Sensitive data discovery	Scans S3 buckets for PII, financial data, and credentials
AWS GuardDuty	Threat detection	Detects anomalous access patterns, brute-force attempts, and data exfiltration
AWS Security Hub	Centralized security monitoring	Aggregates security findings from AWS services & third-party tools
AWS CloudTrail	User activity logs	Tracks API calls and detects unauthorized access
AWS Config	Configuration monitoring	Alerts if sensitive data is exposed (e.g., public S3 buckets)
üõë 2. Prevention: Securing Sensitive Data
Service	Purpose	Key Features
AWS IAM	Access control	Enforces least privilege using IAM policies and SCPs
AWS KMS (Key Management Service)	Encryption	Encrypts sensitive data stored in AWS services
AWS WAF	Web protection	Blocks SQL injection and XSS attacks to prevent data leaks
Amazon VPC	Network isolation	Restricts access using private subnets and security groups
AWS Secrets Manager	Secret storage	Securely manages API keys, credentials, and passwords
üö® 3. Response: Mitigating Data Leaks
Service	Purpose	Key Features
AWS CloudWatch	Real-time alerts	Triggers alerts on suspicious activities (e.g., data transfer spikes)
AWS Lambda	Automated response	Runs automated scripts when a data leak is detected
AWS Incident Manager	Incident response	Manages and automates security incidents
AWS Audit Manager	Compliance tracking	Ensures regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
AWS Detective	Security investigation	Analyzes logs to trace data leaks and attacks
üîó Example: Automating Data Leak Detection with Macie
1Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Amazon Macie

aws macie2 enable-organization-admin-account --admin-account-id 123456789012

2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure an S3 Data Leak Alert

aws macie2 create-findings-filter --name "PII Detection" --action ARCHIVE \
--criteria '{"criterion":{"category":{"eq":["SensitiveData:S3Object/Personal"]}}}'

3Ô∏è‚É£ Automate Incident Response with Lambda

Create a Lambda function that automatically revokes access if a sensitive file is exposed.

import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    
    for record in event['Records']:
        bucket_name = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
        object_key = record['s3']['object']['key']
        
        # Make file private if leaked
        s3.put_object_acl(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=object_key, ACL='private')

    return "Access revoked for leaked data"
