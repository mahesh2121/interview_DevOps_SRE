Multiple Labels in Prometheus

This image illustrates the concept of using multiple labels to provide more granular information about a metric in Prometheus.

Scenario:

Let's consider an e-commerce API with an /auth endpoint that supports various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE).

Without Multiple Labels:

We might have a single metric like requests_auth_total to count all requests to the /auth endpoint. However, this wouldn't give us insights into which HTTP methods are being used most frequently.

With Multiple Labels:

By introducing two labels:

    path: Represents the endpoint path.
    method: Represents the HTTP method.

We can create a more informative metric: requests_total{path="/auth", method="get"}, requests_total{path="/auth", method="post"}, and so on.

Benefits:

    Granular Analysis: We can now analyze request patterns based on both the endpoint and the HTTP method used.
    Flexible Queries: PromQL allows us to filter and aggregate data based on these labels. For example:
        requests_total{path="/auth", method="post"} - Count of POST requests to the /auth endpoint.
        sum(requests_total{path="/auth"}) - Total requests to the /auth endpoint regardless of the method.
    Improved Monitoring: We can set up alerts based on specific HTTP methods or combinations of labels.

In Summary

Multiple labels provide a powerful way to categorize and analyze metrics in Prometheus. By using labels strategically, you can gain a deeper understanding of your systems and create more effective monitoring strategies.
