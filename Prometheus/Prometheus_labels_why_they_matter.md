Prometheus Labels and Why They Matter

The Challenge:

Without labels, imagine you're monitoring an e-commerce API. You might have separate counters for each endpoint:

    requests_auth_total
    requests_user_total
    requests_products_total
    requests_cart_total
    requests_orders_total

To get the total number of requests across all endpoints, you'd have to manually sum each counter, which is cumbersome and error-prone.

The Solution: Labels

Labels provide a structured way to add dimensions to your metrics. By using a label like path, we can tag each request with its endpoint:

    requests_total{path="/auth"}
    requests_total{path="/user"}
    requests_total{path="/products"}
    requests_total{path="/cart"}
    requests_total{path="/orders"}

Benefits:

    Easy Aggregation: Now, calculating the total requests is simple: sum(requests_total)
    Granular Insights: You can easily filter and group data based on labels. For example:
        requests_total{path="/user"} - Total requests for the user endpoint
        sum(requests_total{path=~"/user|/products"}) - Total requests for user and product endpoints
    Flexible Queries: PromQL, Prometheus's query language, allows for powerful filtering and aggregation based on labels.

Example:

# HELP requests_total The total number of HTTP requests
# TYPE requests_total counter
requests_total{path="/auth"} 100
requests_total{path="/user"} 200
requests_total{path="/products"} 300
requests_total{path="/cart"} 150
requests_total{path="/orders"} 50

In this example, requests_total is a counter metric with the path label. The value of the label indicates the endpoint for each request.

In Summary

Labels are a fundamental concept in Prometheus. They provide structure, flexibility, and ease of analysis to your monitoring data. By using labels effectively, you can gain deeper insights into your systems and applications.
